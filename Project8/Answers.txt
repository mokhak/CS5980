The number of steps to add to the binary search tree is O(log n) where
n is the number of node that you're trying to add to the tree.

According to the insertion timing it seems like insertion with recursion
takes a shorter amount of time and therefore is better for innsertion.

Psuedo code for deleting a node from a tree:

tree.find(node_to_be_deleted)
if(root found has no children):
    delete(node)
elsif(root has children):
    rearrange the node and children after deleting
else
    if key not found:
        let user know
