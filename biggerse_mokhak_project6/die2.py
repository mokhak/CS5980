"""
The Die class represents a die with a specified number of sides
(selected by passing an integer to the constructor).
The die must have at least two sides and no more than 100.
If a value outside of this range is attempted, the die should
default to having six sides. The current value of the die
should be set to an integer between one and the number of sides
the die has, chosen at random when the die object is constructed
and whenever the roll() method is called. For example,
for a six sided die, the current value must be set to one of the
 following values with equal likelihood: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
